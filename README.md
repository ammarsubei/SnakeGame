# SnakeGame
The infamous snake game, written in Processing (Java), mainly for learning purposes (object-oriented programming and visuals).  
Change snake direction using arrow keys, and pause the game by hitting "ENTER/RETURN".

While playing the game, pressing mouse1 increases snake length by 2, and pressing mouse2 resets snake length.
